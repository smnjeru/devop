	<p>  It's a story about entrepreneur, and risk, and hard work, 
and knowing where you want to go and being willing to do what it takes 
to get there. And it's a story about believing in your idea even when 
maybe some other folks don't, and about sticking to your guns. Sam 
Walton. Meet a genuine American folk hero cut from the homespun cloth of 
America's heartland: Sam Walton, who turned a single dime store in a 
hardscrabble cotton town into Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the 
world. The undisputed merchant king of the late twentieth century, Sam 
never lost the common touch. Here, finally, Sam Walton tells his 
extraordinary story in his won inimitable words. Genuinely modest, but 
always sure of his ambitious and achievements, Sam shares his thinking 
in a candid, straight-from-the-shoulder style.
